💘 Tinder App SQL Analysis

 Project Overview
This project simulates the backend database of a dating application (inspired by Tinder) and dives into real-world SQL queries for user behavior analysis, match interactions, and subscription insights.
The database models all core functionalities of a modern dating app—user profiles, swipes, matches, messages, and subscriptions—and is ideal for practicing complex SQL operations in a realistic scenario.

Database Schema
The project consists of the following tables:

Table    	Description
Users:  User profiles with demographics and location
Swipes: 	Tracks swipe interactions (Like/Dislike) between users
Matches:	contains successful matches between two users
Messages: 	store messages exchanged between matched users
Subscriptions: Subscription details (Free, Plus, Gold, Platinum) for each user

SQL script includes schema creation, data population, and business queries.
